# Electioneering

Electioneering is a strategy game in which you campaign for President against your friends. 

It is played through Discord as a discord bot, with a variety of modes including First-Past-The-Post, Ranked Choice Voting, or Popular Vote, to name a few. The bot used a Node.js backend and the official version was online from January 2021 to June 2021, at which point it stopped recieving updates and was shut down.
